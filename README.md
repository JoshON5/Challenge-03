# Fresh Passwords Only

## Description

This is application was deployed to generate randomized passwords utilizing upper-case, lower-case, numbers and special characters to generate a random password containing 8-128 characters. Utilizing JavaScript, I was able to create window prompts for each question to the user of asking them what kind of Password they want to create. Each Criteria was given a window prompt and there were also alert windows created to prevent Users from choosing characters outside the number range and not utilizing any of the criterias. Hopefully in the future this application would be used to help users when creating new accounts for a website.
